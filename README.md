### Working towards an Anti-Surveillance Manifesto

## Introduction 
 
  I feel the violent  grip of surveillance technology  in my daily existence. On my commute to school on the N-Train from Astoria to Union Square I can’t help but document the current tensions of the physical and digital worlds constantly clashing like a game of cat and mouse. The scope of investigating mass surveillance campaigns on Black, brown, and marginalized communities is ambiguous. The idea of Surveillance and technology as constructs can be  both tangible and beyond our control.  Tangible in a way because we encounter these constructs everyday when we look down at our phones. We can click a button or swipe on a screen for instant access to information. What feels beyond our control are the mechanisms our phone or computer uses to get that instant information, maybe it's a  notification from Amazon that your package is at the door. This separation of control is what institutions and individuals who operate in surveillance capitalism want us to think is the case. Late stage capitalism is creating a dark and twisted future timeline. As explained by David Harvey’s theory of time-space compression, globalized production and credit compression are creating new threads of digital feudalism. A handful of tech companies monopolize older functions of capitalism such as surplus value. I believe we are seeing new forms of an old feudalist system. Tech companies finance the global military networks who are directly tied to the police brutality on Black, brown, and marginalized individuals. The violent history and current state of policing in America is detrimental both visibly and discreetly to Black, brown, and marginalized communities. I believe that we are not the trauma of our past, but the living legacy of our ancestors' teachings and imaginations. An abolition based anti-surveillance tool must exist in and survive this reality to deconstruct mechanisms of violence in order to build something new, a collective future. 


## Thesis Objective 

My thesis is contributing to the counter-surveillance space, researching evolving  surveillance technology on the black community. I am investigating surveillance to find out how communities are fighting back against newer formations of surveillance technology. This investigation starts with understanding the history of state surveillance and black resistance. I map movements of resistance against state sponsored surveillance using archives, empirical data, and data visualization. These methods will inform our communities on how we resist and decode different forms of surveillance, and how to be seen not watched as a community.


## Theoretical Framework

In my process of decoding surveillance I take notes from Simone Brown, creating  my own dimension from the Veillance Plane to define the history I am mapping out. With Steve Mann’s Surveillance plane and Simone Brown’s analysis connecting slavery to the act of watching I can imagine and create the relationship of souevillance and surveillance through past, present, and future.  I look to her critique on surveillance and defining new forms of surveillance as inspiration when thinking about my research. My genealogical timeline synthesizes the evolution of Black radical theory defined by Cedric Robinson and its manifestations with the history of technology. This mapping exercises amplifies and translates community base counter-surveillance tactics as a homage to a long history of Black radical tradition theorized by Cedric Robision. To articulate the environmental crisis surveillance technology inflicts onto Black resistance I incorporate Black ecologies as the foundation of my practice.  Black Ecology centers black identity and agency in both the physical and metaphysical world. Centering my work in Black Ecology allows for a transcorporal perspective of how the obstruction of black resistance endangered society as a whole. To understand the political and economic implications of evolving technology I incorporate Shoshana Zuboff’s theory of Surveillance capitalism. Zuboff explains   how capital's logic has created a new hammer, where our behavior and future selves are bought and sold in Surveillance Captiliams and the technology it uses. I argue that surveillance capitalism is working towards the expansion of police surveillance on marginalized communities. 


## Research Methods 

My research methodology is an act of artistic expression and care through both quantitative and qualitative data. When looking at the long history of black liberation in America it all derives from the ability to resist. I have developed my own working digital principles to investigate surveillance technology and forms of counter-surveillance. My practice is largely inspired by the scholar Ruha Benjamin, specifically the way she developed a language of abolition. I have developed an index with new language and symbols to investigate different forms of surveillance. My empirical process incorporates exercises of Narrative Lyricism, a form of investigation inspired by the scholar Fred Moten. These journal entries are documentations of surveillance in my environment such as police presence, private and public security, as well as my emotional state while being watched. It is in this way that the foundation of my research begins with reflection on lived experience of myself and others. I have developed a practice of Detachment, which is a collection of counter-surveillance measures to obstruct Surveillance Capitalism. The goal is not to completely isolate myself from this technology because it is an evolving cycle. The goal is to gain awareness of these systems and find intervention points on mitigating ones participation in the new Jim Code. Through data analysis I recreate “crime zones' ' developed through predictive policing technology.This process of recreating the “crime zone”  is a reanimation of the technology used against Black, brown, and marginalized communities. By doing this practice I can begin to imagine ways of intervening and obstructing this tech.


## Reanimating Police Survallence 

_"The colonial world is a compartmentalized world. It is obviously as superfluous to recall the existence of "native" towns and European towns, of schools for "natives" and schools for Europeans, as it is to recall apartheid in South Mrica. Yet if we penetrate inside this compartmentalization we shall at least bring to light some of its key aspects. By penetrating its geographical configuration and classification we shall be able to delineate the backbone on which the decolonized society is reorganized."_
-Franz Fanon The Wretched of the Earth

The process of “reanimating” police surveillance tech is the “geographical configuration'' mentioned by Fanon in his Chapter “Violence” in Wretched of the Earth (Fanon, F 1963). Fanon  speaks on the idea of decolonization as an act of reinterpreting a narrative inflicted on land. My data analysis takes inspiration from Fanon and his idea of penetrating colonial systems, for the purposes of exposing mechanisms of police surveillance.
