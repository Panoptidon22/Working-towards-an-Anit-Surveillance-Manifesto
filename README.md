## Introduction 
 
The violent history and current state of policing in America is detrimental both visibly and discreetly to Black, brown, and marginalized communities. I believe that we are not the trauma of our past, but the living legacy of our ancestors' teachings and imaginations. An abolition-based anti-surveillance tool must exist in, and survive this reality to deconstruct mechanisms of violence in order to build something new, a collective future. 

The scope of investigating mass surveillance campaigns on Black, brown, and marginalized communities is both vast and ambiguous. Surveillance technology is a construct that can feel both tangible and beyond our control. It is tangible because we encounter these constructs everyday when we look down at our phones. We can click a button or swipe on a screen for instant access to information. What feels beyond our control are the mechanisms our phone or computer uses to get that instant information, maybe it's the invisibility of where your information is going to or coming from when logging into social media. I feel the violent grip of surveillance technology in my daily existence. On my commute to school on the N-Train from Astoria to Union Square I can’t help but document the tensions of the physical and digital worlds constantly clashing like a game of cat and mouse. My research stems from a sense of urgency to demystify the distance between personal agency and technology, which surveillance capitalism works to uphold.



## Thesis Objective 

In my thesis project, I map movements of resistance against state sponsored surveillance using archives, empirical data, and data visualization. I contribute to the counter-surveillance discipline, researching evolving technology used on Black and marginalized communities. My investigation starts with understanding the history of state surveillance and Black resistance. I use methods of historical mapping and diagramming to show the ways our ancestors have resisted and decoded different forms of surveillance. It is critical that we share with each other how to be seen and not watched as a community. While continually investigating how the diaspora is fighting back against newer formations of surveillance technology, I develop my own methods of counter-surveillance and tools to share these tactics through education. 



## Theoretical Framework

In my process of decoding surveillance I reference the work of writer and researcher Simone Brown. Brown redefined Steve Mann’s Surveillance Plane, which is a diagram developed to categorize and measure different forms of surveillance. I am interested in Brown’s analysis and formation of the Veillance Plane, a new diagram which connects slavery to the development of surveillance as a construct. In my work, I add another dimension to the Veillance Plane as a means to classify the historical data I am mapping. By utilizing the Veillance Plane I create a visual relationship of surveillance, the act of watching, and souevillance, the act of watching back, between the past, present, and future.  

To articulate the environmental crisis surveillance technology inflicts on the Black diaspora, I incorporate the theory of Black ecology as the foundation of my practice. Black ecology centers Black identity and agency in both the physical and metaphysical world. Centering my work in Black ecology allows for an environmental perspective of how surveillance technology and the obstruction of Black resistance endangers society as a whole. I have created a genealogical timeline synthesizing the evolution of Black radical theory, as defined by Cedric Robinson, with the history of technology. This timeline amplifies community-based counter-surveillance tactics by identifying significant people, events, and technology.

To understand the political and economic implications of evolving technology I incorporate Shoshana Zuboff’s theory of surveillance capitalism. Zuboff explains how capital's logic has developed a new system where our behavior is bought and sold and our futures are predicted. This system thrives under surveillance capitalism and its technology. I argue that surveillance capitalism is expanding police surveillance on marginalized communities with the goal of “total certainty” regarding predictive policing. Zuboff states, “surveillance capitalism’s economic imperatives are like the body's soft tissues that cannot be seen in an X-ray but do the real work of binding muscle and bone” (Zuboff, S 2020). This understanding of connecting surveillance capitalism to the body is how we must understand the network of police surveillance. My investigation of police surveillance is a “geographical configuration,'' a term used by Frantz Fanon in his chapter “Violence” in _The Wretched of the Earth_ (Fanon, F 1963). Fanon speaks on the idea of decolonization as an act of reinterpreting a forced narrative inflicted on both people and land. My data visualizations take inspiration from Fanon and his idea of penetrating colonial systems, for the purposes of exposing mechanisms of police surveillance.



## Research Methodology

My research methodology takes the form of artistic expression, historical research, and collecting and mapping qualitative and quantitative data. I center personal experience and care as values for cultivating resistance. My practice is largely inspired by the scholar Ruha Benjamin, specifically the way she developed a language of abolition. I have developed my own working digital principles as well as an index of new language and symbols to investigate surveillance technology and forms of counter-surveillance. 

My empirical process involves exercises of “Narrative Lyricism”, a form of investigation  coined by the scholar Fred Moten. These journal entries are documentations of surveillance in my environment such as police presence, private and public security, as well as my emotional experience while being watched. It is in this way that the foundation of my research begins with reflection on lived experience of myself and others. I have developed a practice of detachment involving a collection of counter-surveillance measures to obstruct surveillance capitalism. The practice of detachment is understanding and implementing cyber-security tools and resources while online. The goal is not to completely isolate myself, but to gain awareness in order to find intervention points for harm reduction.
 
Through qualitative research I recreate “crime zones” developed by predictive policing technology. This process of recreating the “crime zone”  is a reanimation of the technology used against Black, brown, and marginalized communities. After the Crime Bill was passed in the early 1990’s, misdemeanors became the most frequent type of arrest, even surpassing felonies. My data visualizations reflect this transition in criminalization by analyzing misdemeanor arrest data. I collected NYPD arrest data from the 2020-2021 calendar year and developed three different maps. By doing this qualitative research I can begin to imagine ways of intervening and obstructing police surveillance.

In New York City, Black and Latinx communities are the heaviest policed in comparison to their white counterparts. Doing a comparative analysis of these demographics shows the extremely different realities of criminalization taking place. While I made a research decision to use Black non-hispanic data as the centerpiece of my analysis, I recognize that the racial categories in the census can be inaccurate and allow for false representation. because my research revolves around the Black experience specifically. According to NPR, the Census data from 2020 shows that people are identifying more with multiple racial groups because of shifting conversations around identity and whiteness. It is important to note that the Census is one of America’s oldest surveillance technologies. In Simone Brown’s book _Dark Matters_ she explains how the Census, established in 1790, was a database which racialized and gendered the population.





### Map 1: Skin Tones

In my first mapping iteration the data visualization software I was using, Carto, generated a skin tone color palette to represent my data on the Black population of New York City and Misdemeanor arrests. I found this range in color a fascinating metaphor for the scarring that happens beneath the skin. My first maps are a bodily representation of the density and concentration of this trauma that forms in different parts of New York City due to police surveillance. I made a design decision to use these colors throughout my visualization process. 





### Map 2: Misdemeanor Arrests Dot Density

In this map I wanted to visualize the Top 3 forms of misdemeanor arrest taking place in relation to the concentration of Black and latnix communities. Being able to toggle through racial populations and different misdemeanor arrests shows the nuances of criminalization and its locality. I used the color palettes I generated from my initial scar tissue mapping for the 3 misdemeanors in a dot density formation.The Top 3 Misdemeanor  arrests are Assault 3, Petit Larceny, and Dangerous Drugs. 





### Map 3: Predpol Reanimation

I outlined the average rate of each racial category in New York City overlaid with the arrest density. This way you can see a clear picture of the density of where misdemeanor arrests are happening within the communities throughout New York City to highlight intervention points. This map specifically resembled police surveillance software like Predpol and Domain Awareness Systems.
